# Errors

| 200                | OK                | Everything worked as expected.                                                                   |
|--------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 400                | Bad Request       | The request was unacceptable, often due to missing a required parameter.                         |
| 401                | Unauthorized      | No valid API key provided.                                                                       |
| 402                | Request Failed    | The parameters were valid but the request failed.                                                |
| 403                | Forbidden         | The API key does not have permissions to perform the request.                                     |
| 404                | Not Found         | The requested resource does not exist.                                                            |
| 409                | Conflict          | The request conflicts with another request (perhaps due to using the same idempotent key).       |
| 429                | Too Many Requests | Too many requests hit the API too quickly. We recommend an exponential backoff of your requests. |
| 500, 502, 503, 504 | Server Errors     | Something went wrong on Trustapâ€™s end. (These are rare.)                                         |
